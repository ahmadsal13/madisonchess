    <h2>2011</h2>
    <p>In 2011 some students approached Mr. Gordon about sponsoring a chess club.  The club began in 2012.  In 2017 we decided to remodel the club as a Table Top Games Club. We encourage students to bring card games and board games from home and play with their friends.

    <h2>January 15, 2018</h2>
    <p>It started out with a lack of time.Four guys who barely know each other were in a group and they had to make a logo. They had no idea what was to come. From their fail the phoenix project was burn to ash and rip to shreds to be reborn into the...DEV's. With their work the group split into threes with each one taking a piece of the puzzle. Ahmad & Michael took the road least travel and further expanded their ideas to help the founder of the chess club and began experimenting with code and taking their ideas to the next level. </p>

    <h2>April 6, 2018</h2>
    <p>It was not easy. The duo were perfect teammates never taking things too seriously and always finding a solution to their problems. Nothing could slow them down. There were issues every now and then. People saying they overconfident and too ambious. Both were true yet that never stop them. Whatever they said they would do from adding music to creating a sign up page they were deteremine to do which they did. Michael being the senior finish his final touches on the site and move on giving the tourch to his best coding teammate Ahmad and wish him luck. With ideas for the future Ahmad hopes to continue working till he leaves and then one day pashing his tourch to a new dev just like Michael did for him.</p>
