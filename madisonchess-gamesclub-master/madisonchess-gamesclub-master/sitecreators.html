    <artical>Ahmad Salem is the mastermind behind the amazing development of the club's website creation. He is one of the founding members of the DEV's, a group of guys who wanted to develop their own site while having a great time. He is one of the biggest nerds
        in the group who is stun by coding almost as much as he loves chess. The overconfident,self reliant smart alec who puts an overload of energy into everything he does. From nerding out on pacific rim to overanalyzing the smallest thing in app development,
        anything tech related makes him smile. His stubborness and confidence fuels him to the point where when he makes a claim he will not stop until the Dev's do it.</artical>
